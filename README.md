Inspiration
=============
In the early stages of my go-kart project, I found a lot of inspiration by watching YouTube videos. I explored various channels where creators shared their builds, offering insights and tips that shaped my approach. Seeing others' innovative solutions and creative designs motivated me to experiment with different ideas and techniques. These videos not only provided technical guidance but also fueled my enthusiasm for the project, helping me visualize what was possible and encouraging me to push the boundaries of my design.

Component Research
=============
All of this went into a spreadsheet I made as I tracked the cost of the parts per item, amount needed, vendor, and schedule for when it would come.

## Wheels
- Spindle kit for the front two wheels
- 5/8th inch bolts for the back two wheels
- Wheels
- Spacers

With all this in mind, I started by searching on YouTube for spindle kits and came across a helpful video. I found a kit listed in the video description, which led me to notice that the bolts for the wheels were 5/8 inch. I wanted to use the same wheels for the rear, so I decided to get 5/8-inch screws for the back as well. I followed the recommendations from the YouTube description for the wheels, ensuring they would fit well with both the front wheels and the 5/8-inch rear bolts.

## Frame
- Aluminum/steel pipes

I found these steel pipes at Home Depot and there wasn't much research gone into this due to the fact I didn't want to order custom pipes.

## Steering wheels
- Standing bearers
- Pipe
- Wheel
- Laser-cut metals

## Engine
- engine
- laser cut engine holder

I tried to get a 78cc engine from Harbor Freight but it was unavailable to be shipped here so I ordered one from Harbor Freight which is 98cc and included a clutch and sprocket plus a chain. This helped as I didn't have to do trial and error in finding parts that find the engine like I would have done with the 78cc.

## Pedals and brakes
- pedals
- brake wires
- Brake drum

I got the brake drum from the same website I got the front axle from

Cad parts screenshots
=============
Note: Regarding Solidworks Parts and Assembly

The parts constructed in Solidworks are not up to scale. This discrepancy arises because most vendors do not give precise measurements of their components. The purpose of designing and constructing the parts and making the assembly is to visually display the functionality and relationship between the components. 

Price sheet is above in file name: Gokart Price sheet

## Assembly

Many parts went into making this part, including spacers between the brake drum and the wheel split rim.

## Front axle connector

For this section, I had to create two separate parts because the right-side front axle faces the opposite direction compared to the left-side front axle. Instead of designing four distinct parts, I only needed to create two different parts and use one part for both sides, maintaining consistency and simplifying the design.

=============
## Step 1
![Screenshot 2024-09-06 174042](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea4ace9-8b19-4d03-81de-267e7aa0839e)

Organized the materials on the table. This is not a step that needea to be included but this helped me in order to check if I have all my materials to start a step. 
## Step 2
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 004851](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d3c573-437a-4a68-90fe-88610937a43e)

Measured how long the width and the length of the go-kart should be and marked them down with a Sharpie.
## Step 3
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 004914](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41e807b7-59f1-444d-beb8-6b277df2308d)

I cut the frame using an angle grinder. This was my first time using an angle grinder, so after cutting the pipes, I often had to use it again to straighten the tubes.
## Step 4
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 004836](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a958046d-2faf-4921-b66a-67c09bfaad7b)

Put the cut frame in place to see if there were any measurements that were off.
## Step 5
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 004903](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/019224af-d48e-4c0a-9fc1-98e64a833e54)

Drilled L brackets in order to connect the tubes tgether and put them in place for welding activities and cold weld glue. This was a great help as i didn not have a designated welding setup with welding magnets that would the pipes together.
## Step 6
![Screenshot 2024-09-06 174050](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f917c6ce-5862-44dc-a617-6a8a78c9ede0)

Put everything together the go-kart on the floor with what parts in their designated and started welding. I used black tape in order to hide my welds as my first time welds were not perfect. i alsoused the black tape to hide, cold weld glue residue.
## Step 7
![Screenshot 2024-09-06 174104](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477ecac3-ece0-4753-a88d-8af6e131f646)

The steering wheel I had listed on my Excel was too big with the outer rim and was 0.75 inches rather than 0.725 inches. With this being the case, I brought the bearings to a Home Depot and found another tube that would fit the bearings. The pipe was a little bigger than anticipated with a length of 3 feet rather than 2 feet, so I had to adjust the angle the steering wheel would rest to be a bit steeper. 
## Step 8
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003442](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed0b156-3ac0-4cd7-b7b1-d7355ee55e92)

Since the bearings might fall or not be at the correct angle, and the supports might not be tall enough if installed at different times, I combined the steps of assembling the go-kart into one. First, I cut the support and glued the bearing to the front of the frame and the support area. This required multiple test trials. To ensure the angles were as close as possible, I used cold weld and secured it with tape after setting the cold weld. I believe this is sufficient, as welding would be difficult due to the bearing and tubes being made of different materials with different welding temperatures. Since I wanted a stable area to rest my feet near the pedals, I added a grill and let everything set with cold weld glue after welding. The same approach was applied here, as the grill and pipes were different materials, so I used little to no welding. Once everything was set, I installed the steering wheel and used tape to mark the approximate height I wanted the steering wheel to sit at by wrapping the tape around the area just above the bearing multiple times. This worked because the tape increased the pipeâ€™s width at that point, preventing the steering wheel from sliding further down. This was a bit of an oversight, as welding a bearing would have looked better, but I chose tape in case I needed to adjust the steering wheel in the future. After that, I welded the tie rod connector to the frame and, as usual, cold welded and taped it afterward.
## Step 9
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003550](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592e17dd-ab05-4723-8a65-ef9d1b345ae7)

On the ground set up where the seat would go while also making sure there was room for the engine behind.
## Step 10
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003604](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7f46738-1d66-44e6-b30b-5e12eedc19e1)

Attached the seat supports and attached the seats using screws I got from home depot.
## Step 11
![Screenshot 2024-09-26 193822](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2c153a8-a177-440c-b672-4afd4db9b677)

Looking down below the seating area, I decided to pivot to help support the seating area so it wouldn't sag down within the area and give less stress to the go-karts' wheel areas.
## Step 12
![Screenshot 2024-09-26 193832](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6029a5a3-758b-4fa7-ae7c-f925b187fd9c)

Getting some shopping cart wheels and using some leftover pipes, I attached the wheels to two pipes and it was perfectly the exact height needed to be attached below the seat. I also made two more for the engine as I didn't want that much stress on the wheel next to engine which would be holdingthe brake drum as well. This of course will affect the steering of the go-kart but I decided the integrity of the go-kart was more important.
## Step 13
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003617](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbc3273c-a70a-40a2-9b1c-26a981fd2092)

I attached the go-kart wheels and the engine supports with its own designated go-kart wheels. Also since the tie rods were too short, I made a home depot trip and got long screw rods that would fit the tie rod connectors. With that, I welded, cold-welded, and then taped the welding and glued mistakes on the steering wheels. Going back to step 8, I also had to untape the steering wheel to lower it further in order for the screw rods to fit.
## Step 14
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003700](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f2484a-ad4c-4140-8159-2fc143d77ffd)

The clutch and sprocket setup had different screw holes to attach it to the wheel, so i drilled new holes to make them match. After attaching the gear to the wheel, I put the engine on the go-kart to see where the correct place to put it and used a bike chain breaker and some pliers to break the chain. I then broight the correct size chain connector in ordertto connect the chain at the corrct lenght I wanted it at.
## Step 15
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003820](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f42c540-4c6a-4314-8723-1c27202802d0)

After marking where the engine should be I attached the engine mount to the go-kart
## Step 16
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003650](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2067a8b5-61d4-420e-9fc8-4d83c64b6e6b)
![Screenshot 2024-09-30 043317](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd9b1905-9480-471d-8c62-861103da2f33)

I attached the engine using some nuts and bolts I had got from Home Depot and then attached the pedal wires wrapping it with tape when itr was next to the chasis to secure a more tough and enhanced fit. Moving on, I used additional tubing, drilled holes in them for the pedals, and then attached the additional tubing to the go-kart so that the pedals would feel like they had more height for a bigger driver like myself. In order to attach the pedal wiring to the engine with greather ease, I removed a part of the engine using a bolt extractor set. The set I brought also came helpfule with filling up air in the tires as some tires needed reajusting before I could fill them with air. It also helped when i was attaching the  brake drum to the wheel.
## Step 17
![Screenshot 2024-09-25 003711](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b4a4ec3-ea64-448c-a1ca-cfd5e9232eb9)

Here is a picture of me sitting on it. Step 17 was just me having fun with the go-kart.

Errors and Solutions
=============

## Tie rods
- The tie rods were too short for the steering mechanism so I had to improvise and use only the connectors within the kit. I went to home depot and home screw rods where the screw would be all over the rod like with the steering wheel and used that instead. This warranted the steering wheel to be lowered also which in turn helped since the steering wheel being lowered made it in a more comfortable spot for reiders.

## Steering wheel
- The steering wheel I got had bad dimensions so I had to take the bearers and go around stores for a better fit. I eventually got a better fit with the problem being it was longer than what I had initially planned. Luckily with the tire rods also being longer than originally planned, the steering wheel was allowed to be lowered more which led to the height difference not being a big factor.

## Welding
- With this being my first tie welding, I was unable to make good welds and was also oblivious to the fact that aluminum and steel wouldn't weld well. So after I welded everything in place I used cold weld glue as well and also used black tape to hide all my welds and cold welding mistakes.
