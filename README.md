Component Research

## Wheels
- Spindle kit for the front two wheels
- ... inch bolts for the back two wheels
- Wheels

With this all in play I first went to YouTube and saw places where you can get spindle kits and came across a YouTube video with one.
Looking down in the description I got one that was listed. With that in play, I saw that the bolts were 5/8th inch bolts for the wheels
and wanted to have the same wheels for the back, so I decided to get 5/8th inch bots for the back. In terms of wheels, I just used whatever
the youtube description listed as well as it would fit well with the front wheels, and with the 5/8th inch back screws it would fit well
with those also.
  












Note: Regarding Solidworks Parts and Assembly

The parts constructed in Solidworks are not up to scale. This discrepancy arises due to the fact most vendors do not give precise measurements of their components. The purpose of designing and constructing the parts and making the assembly is to serve as a visual display of the functionality and relationship between the components.
