Inspiration
=============
In the early stages of my go-kart project, I found a lot of inspiration by watching YouTube videos. I explored various channels where creators shared their builds, offering insights and tips that shaped my approach. Seeing others' innovative solutions and creative designs motivated me to experiment with different ideas and techniques. These videos not only provided technical guidance but also fueled my enthusiasm for the project, helping me visualize what was possible and encouraging me to push the boundaries of my design.

Component Research
=============
## Wheels
- Spindle kit for the front two wheels
- 5/8th inch bolts for the back two wheels
- Wheels
- Spacers

With all this in mind, I started by searching on YouTube for spindle kits and came across a helpful video. I found a kit listed in the video description, which led me to notice that the bolts for the wheels were 5/8 inch. I wanted to use the same wheels for the rear, so I decided to get 5/8-inch screws for the back as well. I followed the recommendations from the YouTube description for the wheels, ensuring they would fit well with both the front wheels and the 5/8-inch rear bolts.

## Frame
- Aluminum/steel pipes

I found these steel pipes at Home Depot and there wasn't much research gone into this due to the fact I didn't want to order custom pipes

## Steering wheels
- Standing bearers
- Pipe
- Wheel
- Laser-cut metals

Note: Regarding Solidworks Parts and Assembly

The parts constructed in Solidworks are not up to scale. This discrepancy arises due to the fact most vendors do not give precise measurements of their components. The purpose of designing and constructing the parts and making the assembly is to serve as a visual display of the functionality and relationship between the components.
